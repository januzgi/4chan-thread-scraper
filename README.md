# 4Chan Thread Scraper

A simple but easy to use and tweak thread scraper. Uses Nightmare to parse threads, and cheerio to help out with object generation. Outputs a JSON file for you to use with other endeavors.

### How to get working.

Have nodejs on your comp. Clone the repo, then open up a terminal in that directory. Type `npm i` to install necessary dependencies, then `node scraper.js` to run the scraper. Change boards at your discretion via the `board` variable.
